                <p>
                    Howdy! I am a sophomore computer science major at Texas A&M University.
                    I decided to create this website page to give people a quick and easy way to learn more about me.
                    The reason I decided to study computer science is because of the instant gratification the programming enables.
                    No other field is able to create something right in front of your eyes and then share it to the world.
                    Apart from coding, my hobbies include video games, watching football (especially aggie football), and hanging with friends.
                    And if you cannot tell from the background picture above, I also love Star Wars.
                <br>
                <br>
                    Below I have listed a few of the projects I have worked on, both for school and independently.
                    If you have any questions at all, or would like to see more, do not at all hesitate to reach out.
