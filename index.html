                <p>
                    Howdy! I am a sophomore computer science major at Texas A&M University.
                    I decided to create this website page to give people a quick and easy way to learn more about me.
                    <!--The reason I decided to study computer science is because of the instant gratification the programming enables.
                    No other field is able to create something right in front of your eyes and then share it to the world.-->
                    Apart from coding, my hobbies include video games, watching football (especially aggie football), and hanging with friends.
                    And if you cannot tell from the background picture above, I also love Star Wars.
                <br>
                <br>
                    Below I have listed a few of the projects I have worked on, both for school and independently.
                    If you have any questions at all, or would like to see more, do not at all hesitate to reach out.

                    <h4>Dungeon Crawler</h4>
                    <p>
                        Dungeon Crawler is a game where the explorer must escape from the dungeon he is trapped in.
                        Within the dungeon there are deadly monsters, treasures, and a few magical surprises.
                        With a few different map choices, the dungeons can pose a challenge to even the most skilled explorers.

                    <h4>Network Router Simulator</h4>
                    <p>
                        Simulated a network packet processing queue in C++. <br>
                        This program reads in sample network packets and processes the packets into a linked list.
                        This program uses: dynamic memory, linked list, queues, file input, classes, templating, and data filtering.
                        Packets are read in through a txt file and then processesd to create a "NetworkPacket" object. 
                        Those objects are then sorted based on their content as well as scanned for suspicious input/blocked addresses. 
                        A linked list is used as the queue to demonstrate a "first-in first-out" approach to handling data.

                    <h4>Color Clicker</h4>
                    <p>
                        Color Clicker is game designed to test your vision and reaction time. 
                        In this game, the player must click the cube that doesn't belong to the rest.
                        While some may be obvious, others pose a true challenge. 
                        Color Clicker is written in Python and uses the Pygame library.
