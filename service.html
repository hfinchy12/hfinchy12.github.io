                <p>Impact is a four-day retreat in August that assist freshman and incoming students with the transition to college. Impact seeks to get these students involved with local churches, on-campus organizations, and service opportunities. I had
                    the privilege of attending Impact as a freshman, even thought it was online due to COVID-19. Impact left me with lifelong friendships and genuine relationships that I would have not gotten otherwise. I had such a good experience with
                    Impact freshman year that I decided to become a counselor and return the favor. My experience as a counselor was incredible, as I was able to walk alongside a handful of freshman guys, and help them with the difficult transition to
                    Texas A&M. I then returned to be a chair for my junior year. My time spent as a chair included equipping counselors for retreat. I was so blessed to be served by Impact, and I am so thankful to serve with Impact.</p>

                <p>Revelation Outdoors is a men's organization at Texas A&M. Revelation Outdoors, or "RevO", is a group of guys who like to fish, hunt, hike, and grow in character. Throughout the semester we go on weekend trips to explore the outdoors, whether
                    that means fishing at the coast, or hiking in Arkansas. We see the outdoors as an escape from our complicated world and we do not take it for granted. In RevO, we also do weekly bible studies and small groups, where we are able to
                    grow in wisdom and truth. These bible studies offer a weekly break from the busyness of college. College is a period of growth, and RevO is no exception, we just spend time building one another up through wisdom and friendships. <br><br>As
                    of my junior year, I have had the privilege of serving as Brotherhood Officer for Revelation Outdoors. My role as an officer is to ensure anyone and everyone in RevO is able to find lasting community. Friendships are an essential part
                    of our lives and I want to make sure that everyone is able to find them. I am responsible for planning social events, leading bible studies and small groups, creating curriculum to develop men of character, and maintaining the structure
                    of the organization.
