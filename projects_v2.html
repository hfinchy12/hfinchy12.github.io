                        Working with a team to develop a point of sale (POS) system for an on-campus restaurant. There are two different phases of the project. The first phase is designing the product in Java, using Java Swing for the GUI. This version of the product was developed in the waterfall development cycle. 
                        The second phase of the project was developed primarily in Javascript. The frontend was made up of React with HTML and CSS, while the backend was made using Express.js. A PostgreSQL database is also used for the backend. The second phase of the project was developed under the agile programming cycle, with three total sprints over seven weeks.
                        <br><br> My role for this project was primarily on the backend, working with HTTP request and database queries. I also responsible for testing the product to ensure product safety and reliability.

                        Dungeon Crawler is a game where the explorer must escape from the dungeon he is trapped in. Within the dungeon there are deadly monsters, treasures, and a couple of magical surprises. With a few different map choices, the dungeons can pose a challenge
                        to even the most skilled explorers.

                        Simulated a network packet processing queue in C++. <br> This program reads in sample network packets and processes the packets into a linked list. This program uses: dynamic memory, linked list, queues, file input, classes, templating,
                        and data filtering. Packets are read in through a text file and then processesd to create a "NetworkPacket" object. Those objects are then sorted based on their content as well as scanned for suspicious input/blocked addresses.
                        A linked list is used as the queue to demonstrate a "first-in first-out" approach to handling data.

                        Color Clicker is game designed to test your vision and reaction time. In this game, the player must click the cube that doesn't belong to the rest. While some may be obvious, others pose a true challenge. Color Clicker is written in Python and uses the
                        Pygame library.

                        This program inserts data into a hashtable using a polynomial rolling hash function. Two different implementations of the hashtable are used to avoid collisions, the first being linear probing and the second being a chaining hashtable. The goal for this
                        program is to create an even distribution of collisions.
                        <br><br> The second half of this program is to use hashing to create s simplified version of a cryptocurrency blockchain. This applications reads in transactions (strings) from the command line to create a blockchain. The transactions
                        are then hashed and paired with a nonce to validate them according to the rules of the blockchain. The constraint for this blockchain is simple to allow for quick mining method.
